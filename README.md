# heroku-utils : The simplified CLI for heroku postgres (for now) operations


This is the missing CLI for heroku's postgres database. Because I think that a steep learning curve in a command line interface for remote postgres operations is a waste of time and mental effort, I created a wraparound for my teammates to use. Hope you find this as useful as I do!

To run this, you will need to download Java 10 from Oracle. In the future, I hope to make this modular and use a lightweight JRE so users have to do nothing more than click on a file to get the interface going.
